To view the html file, it is best to use a browser. There are command line web browsers. I use lynx.

lynx hello.html

Also, html isn't a programming language, it is a mark up language, so there is a bit more going on with hello.html than necessary. For the bare minimum, but still get a browser to display "Hello World", simple.html is provided.
