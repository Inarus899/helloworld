# helloworld
A bunch of hello_world programs and scripts. Everything can be ran in a bash shell on Ubuntu 22.04, though you might need to install additional software from repositories. I'm fairly certain everything was installed using apt install except for what is needed for LOLCODE.

See individual directories for more instructions.
